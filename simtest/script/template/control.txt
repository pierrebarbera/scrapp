   Another useful thing to know is that anything after a forward slash and star
   is ignored until INDELible sees a star followed by a forward slash later on.

[TYPE] NUCLEOTIDE 1	//  EVERY control file must begin with a [TYPE] command.
			//  The number after "NUCLEOTIDE" can be 1 or 2 and chooses the
